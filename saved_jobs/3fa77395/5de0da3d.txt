The paper by Prakash et al. highlights HR as a major pathway for repairing DNA double-strand breaks in mammalian cells, emphasizing the role of proteins like RAD51, BRCA1, and BRCA2 in this process. The physiological importance of HR is underscored by its association with genomic stability and its role in preventing cancer predisposition and developmental defects. Similarly, the paper by Roy et al. describes BRCA2 as a mediator of HR, which is crucial for high-fidelity DNA repair during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. The involvement of HR in maintaining genome stability and tumor suppression is further supported by Li and Heyer, who discuss HR as a DNA metabolic process found in all forms of life, including humans.\\n\\nWhile the evidence overwhelmingly supports the occurrence of HR in humans, some papers provide context on the relative contribution of HR compared to other DNA repair mechanisms. For instance, the paper by Mahaney et al. notes that non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is considered the major pathway for repairing ionizing radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks in human cells, although HR is also a significant pathway. This suggests that while HR is crucial, it is not the sole mechanism for DNA repair in humans.\\n\\nOverall, the evidence strongly supports the claim that homologous recombination occurs in humans. The detailed mechanistic insights provided by multiple studies, along with the identification of key proteins involved in HR, affirm its role in DNA repair and genome stability. The caveats regarding the relative contribution of HR compared to other pathways do not detract from the validity of the claim but rather provide a broader understanding of DNA repair mechanisms in humans. Therefore, the claim is rated as highly supported with a score of 9.\", \"claimRating\": 9, \"usage_stats\": {\"prompt_tokens\": 3698, \"completion_tokens\": 448, \"total_tokens\": 4146, \"total_cost\": 0.0137}}",
