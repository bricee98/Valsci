The paper by Filardo et al. demonstrates that estrogen action via the GPCR GPR30 involves the stimulation of adenylyl cyclase and subsequent cAMP-mediated signaling, indicating a direct interaction between cAMP and GPCRs in modulating cellular pathways. Similarly, Calebiro et al. provide evidence that GPCRs can continue to stimulate cAMP production even after internalization, suggesting a sustained interaction between cAMP and GPCRs beyond the cell surface. Additionally, the study by Salinthone et al. shows that lipoic acid stimulates cAMP production through both GPCR-dependent and independent mechanisms, further supporting the role of GPCRs in cAMP signaling.\\n\\nHowever, there are some caveats and nuances to consider. The paper by Gidon et al. highlights that while GPCRs can sustain cAMP signaling after internalization, this process is subject to regulation by other proteins such as \\u03b2-arrestins and the retromer complex, which can attenuate cAMP production. This suggests that the interaction between cAMP and GPCRs is not straightforward and can be modulated by additional factors. Furthermore, the study by Tang et al. discusses how different G protein subunits can have opposing effects on cAMP production, with G\\u03b1s stimulating and G\\u03b1i inhibiting adenylyl cyclase activity, indicating that the interaction between cAMP and GPCRs is complex and context-dependent.\\n\\nOverall, the evidence strongly supports the claim that cAMP interacts with GPCRs, as multiple studies demonstrate this interaction in various contexts and mechanisms. While there are regulatory factors and complexities involved, the fundamental interaction between cAMP and GPCRs is well-documented. Therefore, the claim is strongly supported, and I would assign a claim rating of 8, reflecting the robust evidence with some acknowledged complexities.\", \"claimRating\": 8, \"usage_stats\": {\"prompt_tokens\": 3002, \"completion_tokens\": 603, \"total_tokens\": 3605, \"total_cost\": 0.0135}}",
